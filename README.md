### About Me

I have Master's degrees in Technology Innovation Management, and Civil and Environmental Engineering (Advanced Infrastructure systems) from Carnegie Mellon University. I have a penchant for Intelligent transportation and applications of Data Science and ML in Mobility, Transportation Management and last mile delivery. 

I bring a unique perspective and expertise in data analytics and machine learning to my role as an Analyst (SAP ML). I work on the building optimization and machine learning pipelines on SAP Data Intelligence to offer solutions to various use cases.


My passion for mobility data analytics and smart infrastructure, combined with my background in Innovation management, have given me a rare and valuable perspective on the intersection of technology and mobility. I am constantly seeking out new challenges and opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge to solve complex problems using data science. 


I am excited to continue learning and growing in these dynamic and rapidly-evolving fields.
